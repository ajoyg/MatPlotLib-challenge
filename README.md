# MatPlotLib-challenge
Module 5 MatPlotLib challenge of the UCB Data Analytics &amp; Vizualization Bootcamp. The Jypyter notebook pymaceuticals.ipynb in the Pymaceuticals folder generates tables and charts needed for the technical report of a clinical study for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), commonly occuring form of skin cancer. The data from the clinical study is in the data folder.

### Analysis
- A total of 248 mice were analyzed, 51% male and 49% female.
- Mice treated with Capomulin (mean tumor volume: 40.67mm3) and Ramicane (mean tumor volume: 40.21mm3) had the smallest tumor volume mean values among all the drug regimen.
- The tumor volumes of mice treated with the Ramicane regimen were closest to the mean with smallest variance (23.48) and standard deviation (4.84).
- When comparing the final tumor volumes of mice in 4 drug regimen - Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin, Infubinol was the only drug regimen that had one outlier. The final tumor volumes for mice treated with Ramicane had the lowest upper and lower bounds.
- There is a positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume for mice treated with the Capomulin drug regimen (0.84).
